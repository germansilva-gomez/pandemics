\title{
Local Linear Estimator of the Two-Dimensional Infection (or Hospitalization) Rate from Missing-Survival-Link Data.
}
\description{
Local linear estimator of the infection or the hospitalization rate in the case of missing-survival-link data (Gámiz et al. 2024a). The rate is assumed to have two dimensions: a one-dimensional marker (typically the notification date) and time (duration). It is assumed the situation of observing aggregated data in the form of occurrences and exposures. The missing-survival link problem means that the duration is not directly observed. The estimator follows from an iterative algorithm where, at each step, full information including duration is estimated first and then, the local linear estimator is computed evaluating the function \code{hazard2D}.

Hazard is assumed having two dimensions: a one-dimensional marker (typically the notification date) and time (duration). It is assumed the situation of observing aggregated data in the form of occurrences and exposure, as  the function \code{hazard2D} does. The difference is that the time dimension (duration) is not directly observed. The estimator follows from an iterative algorithm where, at each step, full information, estimating the duration, is constructed first and then the local linear estimator is computed evaluating the function \code{hazard2D}. See more details on the local linear hazard estimator in the documentation of \code{\link{hazard2D}}.

To estimate the infection rate we assume that each day (z), we have information on the number of people tested positive. The vector of occurrences (\code{Oi.z})  is the observed number of people tested positive each day, removing the first \code{d} days. Here \code{d} is typically 1 (an infected person might infect one day after being tested positive), see the examples below. The vector of exposure (\code{Ei.z}) is the observed number of people tested positive each day, removing the last \code{d} days.

To estimate the hospitalization rate we assume that each day (z), we have information on  the number of new hospitalizations (\code{Oi.z}), and the number of people tested positive (\code{Ei.z})  each day.
