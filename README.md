# pandemics

The pandemics package provides a comprehensive dynamic framework to describe and forecast the spread and severity of a developing pandemic.
We introduce a new methodology in survival analysis that reveals the hidden duration component within the data, ensuring that the proposed approach is transparent, intuitive, and easy to communicate.

Our framework relies on what we call available data — routinely reported daily counts of infections, hospitalizations, deaths (both in and out of hospitals), and recoveries.

This repository contains the R package that provides all the functions and datasets required to reproduce the results presented in Gámiz et al. (2025a) and Gámiz et al. (2025b). In addition, two vignettes are included to guide users through the process of reproducing all results.

Finally, as supplementary materials, the repository also includes:

- an R script to reproduce the number of deaths,
- the dataset containing out-of-hospital deaths, and
- two additional R scripts with the code used to reproduce the infection and survival indicators.
